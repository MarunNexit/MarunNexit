## Hello World ðŸ‘‹
I'm a recent Software Engineering grad who dove headfirst into the world of code and came out with a shiny new degree and an even shinier passion for tech. ðŸ’»âœ¨ I love a good challenge, whether it's nailing projects, acing exams, or diving into extracurricular tech adventures.

## Here's a taste of what I've been up to:
- [Job Search Platform (June 2024)](https://github.com/MarunNexit/Search_Job_Website): Built a job search site with Angular, .NET Core, and SQL Server. Managed with Jira, versioned with GitHub, designed on Figma, and added animations with Rive. It was a blast! ðŸš€
