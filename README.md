## Hello World ðŸ‘‹
I'm a recent Software Engineering grad who dove headfirst into the world of code and came out with a shiny new degree and an even shinier passion for tech. ðŸ’»âœ¨ I love a good challenge, whether it's nailing projects, acing exams, or diving into extracurricular tech adventures.

## Here's a taste of what I've been up to:
- [Job Search Platform (June 2024)](https://github.com/MarunNexit/Search_Job_Website): Built a job search site with Angular, .NET Core, and SQL Server. Managed with Jira, versioned with GitHub, designed on Figma, and added animations with Rive. It was a blast! ðŸš€ 
- [Tattoo Salon Website (January 2023)](https://github.com/MarunNexit/tattoo-salon): Crafted a seamless web platform for "Kurisu Tattoo" using React.js, Node.js, Firebase, and Bootstrap. It transformed the salon's operations! ðŸ–Œ
- [Publishing House Website (December 2023)](https://github.com/MarunNexit/aws_next): Created a scalable website using Next.js, hosted on AWS Amplify with secure authentication via AWS Cognito and backend processes by AWS Lambda. Data stored in AWS RDS. Smooth and secure! ðŸ“šðŸ”’
- [Watch Website (Training) (July 2023)](https://github.com/MarunNexit/Culinary). Moto 360 Gen3 wristwatch promotional website created for educational purposes using ASP.NET
- [MVP Cooking site (June 2023)](https://github.com/MarunNexit/Culinary). The cooking website was created for educational purposes on Ruby on Rails


## More About Me:
I'm the go-to full-stack developer, tackling both frontend and backend tasks. Currently, I'm sharpening my DevOps skills and diving deeper into cloud infrastructure. ðŸŒ©

I wrapped up my Bachelor's degree with honors and interned at EPAM, getting hands-on with C# and .NET, and mastering test-driven development. Plus, I earned a certification from EPAM's IT Marathon 3.0.

Always learning, always coding, and ready to smash expectations out of the park. Let's build something awesome together! ðŸŒŸ
